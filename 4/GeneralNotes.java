So I think the assignment wants to create an Interface called Token, which has two properties, string and description.
This Interface will be implemented by two (maybe one) class which has the constructor, which will set the string and description by getter/setters.   The types are to be immutable, and I am not quite sure how to instantiate them.
The driver class should call the parsing method, and the parsing method should create a new Token for each token it finds, whether it is a WordToken or a NumberToken (again I am not sure if it is one class and the description changes, or two separate classes).
